#Analysis of western corn rootworm resistance to Cry3Bb1 corn in populations from Iowa, Nebraska and Minesota.

##Introduction

Data and code and notes to analyze the genetics of *Diabrotica virgifera virgifera* resistance to Cry3Bb1 maize. Resistant populations originate from Nebraska, Iowa and Minnesota. Because resitance has apeared rapidly and almost simulutaneously over a wide area, we want to know:

1. How many loci are involved in the resistance mechanism?
2. Have the same loci responded to selection in different locations?

We will be tackling this using two approaches.

1. A genome scan of lab-based re-selection experiments
2. QTL mapping.
