##Single allele

Testing that the single allele frequency sampler behaves correctly.


We will test based on sampling 50 / 100 copies of the focal allele. Here's the likelihood curve associated with that sample.

```{r plot_like}
curve(dbinom(50, 100, x), xlab="p", ylab="likelihood", lwd=2, col='blue')
```

Execute some python code to generate a sample

```{python}
import os
os.chdir("..")
import alleleFreqs as af
s = af.singleAllele(50, 100, 0.001)
out = open("tests/tmp.txt", "w")
for i in range(0, 10000):
  out.write(str(s.getFreq()) + '\n')
out.close()

```
Read in the simulated frequencies and clean up tmp file

```{r read_freqs}
freqs <- read.table("tmp.txt")[,1]
file.remove("tmp.txt")

```

Compare distribution of simulated frequencies to scaled likelihood curve.

```{r plot_freqs_curve}
h <- hist(freqs, 
          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01), 
          col = colors()[399], 
          xlab = "p", 
          ylab = "count", 
          main = "")

curve(dbinom(50, 100, x)*sum(h$counts),
      from = 0, to = 1,
      n = length(h$breaks),
      add=T,
      lwd=3,
      col='blue')
```

Looks like everything is behaving as it should!

Double check with counts of 20 / 100 and 80 / 100:

20 / 100

```{python, , echo=FALSE}
import os
os.chdir("..")
import alleleFreqs as af
s = af.singleAllele(20, 100, 0.001)
out = open("tests/tmp.txt", "w")
for i in range(0, 10000):
  out.write(str(s.getFreq()) + '\n')
out.close()

```

```{r read_freqs_2, echo=FALSE}
freqs <- read.table("tmp.txt")[,1]
file.remove("tmp.txt")

```

```{r plot_freqs_curve_2, echo=FALSE}
h <- hist(freqs, 
          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01), 
          col = colors()[399], 
          xlab = "p", 
          ylab = "count", 
          main = "")

curve(dbinom(20, 100, x)*sum(h$counts),
      from = 0, to = 1,
      n = length(h$breaks),
      add=T,
      lwd=3,
      col='blue')
```

80 / 100

```{python, , echo=FALSE}
import os
os.chdir("..")
import alleleFreqs as af
s = af.singleAllele(80, 100, 0.001)
out = open("tests/tmp.txt", "w")
for i in range(0, 10000):
  out.write(str(s.getFreq()) + '\n')
out.close()

```

```{r read_freqs_3, echo=FALSE}
freqs <- read.table("tmp.txt")[,1]
file.remove("tmp.txt")

```

```{r plot_freqs_curve_3, echo=FALSE}
h <- hist(freqs, 
          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01), 
          col = colors()[399], 
          xlab = "p", 
          ylab = "count", 
          main = "")

curve(dbinom(80, 100, x)*sum(h$counts),
      from = 0, to = 1,
      n = length(h$breaks),
      add=T,
      lwd=3,
      col='blue')
```

##Multiple alleles

Checking that things still behave as expected when extending to >1 allele. For simplicity we will test with 2 alleles samplesd at 75 / 100 and 25 / 100.

Execute python code to generate some samples

```{python}
import os
os.chdir("..")
import alleleFreqs as af
a = af.MultiAllele([75, 25], 0.001)
out = open("tests/tmp.txt", "w")
for i in range(0, 10000):
  out.write('\t'.join([str(x) for x in a.getFreqs()]) + '\n')
out.close()

```

read in data and clean up

```{r read_freqs_4}
freqs <- read.table("tmp.txt")
file.remove("tmp.txt")

```

Plot histograms of simulated frequencies with scaled likelihood curves.

```{r plot_sim_freqs_likes}
h <- hist(freqs[,1], 
          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01), 
          xlim = c(0, 1), 
          col = colors()[399], 
          main = "", 
          xlab = "p")

curve(dbinom(75, 100, x) * sum(h$counts), 
      from = 0, to = 1, 
      n = length(h$breaks), 
      add = T, 
      col = 'blue', 
      lwd = 2)

h <- hist(freqs[,2], 
          breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 1, by = 0.01), 
          xlim = c(0, 1), 
          col = colors()[373], 
          add = T)

curve(dbinom(25, 100, x) * sum(h$counts), 
      from = 0, to = 1, 
      n = length(h$breaks), 
      add = T, 
      col = colors()[507], 
      lwd = 2)

```

Looks like we are in good shape!
